# Weather Dashboard
You are in one of the big cities such as Chicago and you aren't entirely sure how warm to dress because you don't know the temperature or the forecast for the week. This is where Weather Dashboard comes in. Just type in Chicago in the search bar and BOOM; weather for the current day AND forecast for the following 5 days, which includes the temperature, wind, and humidity! What more could you ever need?
